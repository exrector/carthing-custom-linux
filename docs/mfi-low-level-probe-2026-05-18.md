# MFi Low-Level Probe

Purpose:

- keep the MFi revival work at the lowest possible layer
- avoid pulling any inherited Spotify userspace back into the active system
- give the project one simple executable that can validate `/dev/apple_mfi`
  and the reverse-engineered ioctl contract

Tool:

- `carthing-mfi-probe`
- direct fallback commands:
  - `carthing-mfi-probe raw-info`
  - `carthing-mfi-probe raw-sign <challenge_hex>`

Commands:

- `carthing-mfi-probe info`
- `carthing-mfi-probe certlen`
- `carthing-mfi-probe serial`
- `carthing-mfi-probe response > pkcs7.bin`
- `carthing-mfi-probe sign <challenge_hex>`

What it depends on:

- only `/dev/apple_mfi`
- no BlueZ
- no `bluetoothd`
- no D-Bus
- no old Spotify runtime pieces

Current live blocker on the 2026-05-18 working image:

- `/dev/apple_mfi` is absent
- no `apple_mfi` modules are visible from the custom rootfs
- `dtb` still contains `spotify_mfi_i2c_pins`
- `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0010` exists on the live device
- `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0010/of_node/compatible = apple_mfi_auth`
- `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0010/modalias = i2c:apple_mfi_auth`
- `/sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0010/driver` is missing
- `/proc/modules` has no `apple_mfi*`
- `/proc/devices` has no `apple_mfi_ioctl`
- `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)` has no `apple_mfi*` files or aliases
- `/dev/i2c-3` can talk to `0x10` directly, but raw reads return only zero-state
  values without the original driver-side prepare/wake sequence

Meaning:

- device-tree presence is not the blocker anymore
- the blocker is missing driver binding / missing module path for `apple_mfi_auth`
- direct userspace I2C is possible, so a clean-room rewrite does not need to
  rediscover the bus wiring
- the next missing piece is the driver-side prepare/wake behavior before cert
  and signature registers become meaningful
- the right next step is to recover only the low-level MFi device path
- once that exists, `carthing-mfi-probe` becomes the first honest live test
  before any new iAP2 implementation is attempted

Minimal live proof command used on the working image:

```sh
ssh root@172.16.42.77 '
  [ -e /dev/apple_mfi ] && echo APPLE_MFI_DEV=yes || echo APPLE_MFI_DEV=no
  [ -e /sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0010 ] && echo I2C_3_0010=yes || echo I2C_3_0010=no
  readlink /sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0010/driver 2>/dev/null || echo DRIVER_LINK=none
  cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/3-0010/modalias
  grep apple_mfi /proc/modules /proc/devices 2>/dev/null || true
'
```

Minimal raw-I2C proof collected on the working image:

```sh
ssh root@172.16.42.77 '
  i2cdetect -y 3
  i2ctransfer -f -y 3 w1@0x10 0x21 r1
  i2ctransfer -f -y 3 w1@0x10 0x12 r8
'
```

Observed state:

- address `0x10` is present on bus `3`
- direct `0x21` read returns `0x00`
- direct `0x12` read returns all zero bytes
- direct `0x30` certlen path is not yet usable without the original
  prepare/wake logic
